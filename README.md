# Outfit Burn

## **Project Idea**
Outfit Burn is a unique platform designed to make fashion both fun and interactive. Users can post images of their outfits or share outfit ideas, and the platform allows other users as well as predefined roasts to **rate** or **roast** these outfits. It's a community-driven approach to blending fashion, humor, and creativity.

## **Features**
- **User-Generated Content:** Users can upload outfit images or share their creative fashion ideas.
- **Interactive Engagement:** Other users can rate outfits with likes or comments and provide humorous roasts.
- **Community Building:** Encourages collaboration and connection through shared creativity and humor.
- **Simple and Fun Interface:** Designed for ease of use, making fashion enjoyable for everyone.

## **Future Enhancements**
- Add a leaderboard to highlight the most liked or roasted outfits.
- Allow users to filter and follow specific themes or trends.

## **Tech Stack**

     - React (with Vite): For building an interactive and responsive user interface.
     - CSS (or Tailwind CSS): For styling and ensuring a visually appealing design.
- Backend:
